    Smell of dough and moist heat, so I go downstairs to see The Baker. She
    makes all the loaves and raspberry pies we eat in the camp, four meals a
    day, so her life is a series of yeast-based time cycles. She sleeps in the
    kitchen, stacks of VHS cassettes on Rumi and Sufi mysticism next to the
    barrels of flour, dried currants (she used to practice dervish dancing).
