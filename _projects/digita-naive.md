title: Too Cool To Pretend To Care
description: |
  In Too Cool To Pretend To Care, Gloriya Komarova is becoming a regular millennium who is gradually beginning to perceive environmental threats. She uses social platforms and most often videos of the vlog genre for her own knowledge and communication, but also for communication with the nearest surroundings. In brief instructional sketches, oscillating on the edge of irony and authentic testimony, she demonstrates her proposed solution to the climate crisis through geoengineering strategies. Geoengineering is a targeted human intervention in natural processes, primarily to permanently or at least temporarily to cool the planet. It is problematic for its critics because it helps to create false beliefs rejecting the necessity of changing lifestyle or social order.

  The aim of the project is to capture the consumer approach of society, the culture of millennials, fake news, as well as planetary and societal changes. It presents a stylized post-ironic testimony of somehow narcissistic millennials whose social platforms have become the main platform for expression, forcing us to reflect on the multitude of information we surround each day and the necessity of their selection.
