S.A.D. or seasonl affective disorder exhibits depressive symptoms, mostly
common in winter months, when we suffer from lack of Vitamin D and serotonin. When
we canâ€™t get enough natural sun light, the we have to help ourselves. SAD lights
are visors caps made exactly for you! You can easily wear them on the head during
all day. Inside of the visors is attched light. Visor is not limiting you during
your favourite physical activity. Choose your design and enjoy your new winter full
of happiness!
